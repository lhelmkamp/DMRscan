\title{Plot the results of methdiffSatScan}
\usage{
plotSatScanresult(result, plottopn = NULL, plotpval = NULL,
  plotfilename = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{result}{is the result of running methdiffSatScan- a list containing a vector of likelihood values for each point, the DMRs which were found with p-value <0.05, the build, and the directory to which we want to write a pdf.}

\item{plottopn}{allows for the plotting of only the top n results by p-value, in case of a large number of identified DMRs.}

\item{plotpval}{allows for plotting of only DMRs with a p-value less than a given value (e.g. 0.001), in case of a large nunmber of identified DMRs.}

\item{plotfilename}{is the name of the pdf file which will be output to the directory listed in result$dir.}
}
\value{
nothing; results are output to pdf.
