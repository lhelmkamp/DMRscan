DNA methylation is a crucial and commonly studied epigenetic mechanism for the regulation of gene expression.  Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) have been implicated in a number of diseases, as well as in a variety of developmental and aging processes.    

The **DMRscan** package allows users to accurately find DMRs using the scan statistic.  **DMRscan** constitues a convenient pipeline linking the sitewise likelihood-based differential methylation statistics calculated by the package **methylSig**,  the free scan statistic software **SaTScan** (via **RSaTScan**), and the plotting capabilities of Gviz [1,2,3,4].

Before downloading DMRscan, please download the free software SaTScan from http://www.satscan.org/.
